# Spring Security Exploration Project

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive exploration of Spring Security, created as a learning sandbox for understanding various aspects of modern security practices within Spring applications. This initiative represents my first hands-on experience with Spring Security, focusing on understanding and implementing crucial security features.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience with key security concepts and mechanisms including:

- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Implementing mechanisms to protect against CSRF attacks.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Setting up CORS to allow/restrict resources based on origin.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Utilizing JWT for stateless authentication.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Managing and verifying user credentials and permissions.
- **User Management**: Techniques for securely managing user information and passwords.
- **OAuth & OpenID Connect**: Integrating third-party authentication to enable OAuth and OpenID Connect.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Security**: For implementing security measures.
- **Java**: Primary programming language.
